# Smartcare Machine Learning
## Model
Where the technical part of the deep learning is, the build and train of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Check it out by [clicking here](https://github.com/Unilasalle-SmartCare/smartcare-machinelearning/tree/master/modelo)

## Server
It is planned in the future to have an api server with the model running (Flask). Check it out by [clicking here](https://github.com/Unilasalle-SmartCare/smartcare-machinelearning/tree/master/server)

## Releases
In order to make it easier to join the features and fixes developed in the project, it was grouped with releases, you can see them by [clicking here](https://github.com/Unilasalle-SmartCare/smartcare-machinelearning/releases).
