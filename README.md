# Smartcare Machine Learning
It is proposed a way to detect wandering activities on alzheimer patients by their movimentation, collected in a non intrusive way.

## Dataset
Generated data on the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/Unilasalle-SmartCare/smartcare-machinelearning/blob/master/modelo/dados/dataset.json).<br>

## Model
Where the technical part of the deep learning is, the build and train of the convolutional neural network (CNN). Check it out by [clicking here](https://github.com/Unilasalle-SmartCare/smartcare-machinelearning/tree/master/modelo)

## Server
It is planned in the future to have an api server with the model running (Flask). Check it out by [clicking here](https://github.com/Unilasalle-SmartCare/smartcare-machinelearning/tree/master/server)
